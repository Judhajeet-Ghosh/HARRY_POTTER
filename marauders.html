<span style="color: deeppink;">The Marauder's Map was a magical document that revealed all of Hogwarts School 
    of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Not only did it show every classroom, every hallway,
     and every corner of the castle, but it also showed every inch of the grounds, as 
     well as all the secret passages that were hidden within its walls and the location 
     of every person in the grounds, portrayed by a dot. It was also capable of 
     accurately identifying each person, and was not fooled by animagi, Polyjuice Potions,
      or invisibility cloaks; even the Hogwarts ghosts were not exempt.
    
    One of the map's possible flaws was that it did not differentiate people who had
     matching names (the shared names were not given a Junior or Senior at the end). Also, 
     it did not seem to show unplottable rooms, as it was Dobby and not the map that 
     revealed the existence and location of the Room of Requirement.
    
    The Chamber of Secrets never appeared on the map either because the creators never
     knew of it or it was unplottable as well, since when Ron and Hermione were in it 
     collecting basilisk fangs, they did not appear on the map similar to the Room of
      Requirement.
      The Marauder's Map was created by Remus Lupin (Moony), Peter Pettigrew
       (Wormtail), Sirius Black III (Padfoot), and James Potter I (Prongs) while
        they were attending Hogwarts. The creation of the map started by 1974 and 
        was finished between 1975 and 1978, because the titles on the map refer 
        to the nicknames of these men in their Animagus forms, and, in Lupin's 
        case, werewolf form. The four created the map via the usage of the Homonculous
         Charm, a powerful and advanced charm that enchanted the map to track the
          movements of everyone in the castle, as well as a charm to insult Severus
           Snape. The ability of Sirius, Peter, and James to become Animagi enabled 
           them to explore the castle grounds by night undetected. The interior of 
           the castle, meanwhile, was mapped over time with the help of James's 
           Invisibility cloak.
