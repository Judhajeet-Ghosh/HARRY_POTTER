   <span style="color:lightblue"> Sirius Black also known as Padfoot or Snuffles 
    (in his Animagus form)  was born on 3 November, 1959,  in the London
    borough of Islington, England, to Orion Black and Walburga Black,
     both of whom were Dark Wizards and second cousins. He was the last
      remaining heir of the House of Black, a once-notable pure-blood
     wizarding family. Sirius had a younger brother, Regulus.He was Sorted 
     into Gryffindor House at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
      which he attended from 1971–1978.As Sirius' relationship with his 
      relatives deteriorated, he gained a lifelong friendship with James
       Potter and Remus Lupin. He was also friends with Peter Pettigrew.
        The four friends, also known as the Marauders, joined the Order of
         the Phoenix to fight against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters 
         during the First Wizarding War. Sirius was named the  godfather
          of Harry James Potter, the only son of James and Lily Potter.
          Sirius was sent to Azkaban, and after twelve years became the only known
           person to escape the prison unassisted. He did it by transforming into
            his Animagus form of a massive black dog often confused with a "Grim",
             an omen said to cause death. Sirius exposed Pettigrew's treachery to his
              old friend Remus and his godson Harry. After Lord Voldemort returned in 
              1995, Sirius rejoined the Order. He was murdered by his cousin Bellatrix
               Lestrange during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and 
               subsequently cleared of all charges by the Ministry of Magic, though 
               it was too late for him to enjoy his freedom.

          He briefly appeared again to Harry through the Resurrection Stone on 2 May,
           1998, along with James and Lily Potter, and Remus Lupin. Harry later named
            his first son James Sirius Potter after him and his best friend James Potter
             .</span>

    <span style="color:cyan">Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
         Dumbledore, O.M.(First Class), Grand Sorc., D. Wiz., X.J. (sorc.), S. of
         Mag.Q. (c. Summer 1881 – 30 June, 1997) was
          an English half-blood wizard, who was the Defence Against
           the Dark Arts Professor, later the Transfiguration Professor, 
           and later the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
            Wizardry. Professor Dumbledore also served as Supreme Mugwump 
            of the International Confederation of Wizards (?–1995) and Chief
             Warlock of the Wizengamot (?–1995; 1996–1997). He was a half
             -blood, Muggle-supporting wizard considered to have been the 
             greatest wizard  of all time. The son of Percival and 
             Kendra Dumbledore, and the elder brother of Aberforth 
             and Ariana.It was through Dumbledore that resistance to the
              rise of Lord Voldemort was formed. He founded and led 
              the Order of the Phoenix against Voldemort during the 
              First Wizarding War. Following Voldemort's sudden return 
              and the start of the Second Wizarding War after the 
              resignation of Cornelius Fudge, Dumbledore swiftly formed 
              and lead the second Order of the Phoenix. He would also 
              support Jacob's sibling in the latter's quest for the
               Cursed Vaults, and consistently aid the trio of Harry, 
               Ron, and Hermione during their first six years at Hogwarts,
                thus leading them to name Dumbledore's Army after him   Due
                 the fact that he had a keen mind and legendary power, 
                 Dumbledore became the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared.
                  He was the wielder and the master of the Elder Wand from 
                  1945 until 1997 and considered by many as the greatest 
                  Hogwarts Headmaster. As he was about to die by a cursed
                   ring, Dumbledore planned his own death with Severus Snape. 
                   Per the plan, Dumbledore was killed by Snape during the
                    Battle of the Astronomy Tower.</span>

<span style="color:gold;"><br>
    Severus Snape (9 January, 1960[1] – 2 May, 1998)
    was an English half-blood wizard serving as Potions Master
     (1981-1996), Head of Slytherin House (1981-1997), Defence Against
      the Dark Arts professor (1996-1997), and Headmaster (1997-1998)
       of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as well as a 
       member of the Order of the Phoenix and a Death Eater. His double
        life played an extremely important role in both of the Wizarding 
        Wars against Voldemort. The only child of Muggle Tobias Snape 
        and Gobstones witch Eileen Snape (née Prince), Severus was 
        raised in the Muggle dwelling of Spinner's End, which was in 
        close proximity to the home of the Evans family, though in a 
        poorer area. He met Lily and Petunia Evans when he was nine.
        Shortly before Lily Evans was murdered by Lord Voldemort, 
        Snape changed sides and became a member of the Order of the
         Phoenix as well as a double agent during the Second Wizarding 
         War. With tremendous difficulty, Snape prevented Lord Voldemort
          from learning the truth about his loyalties. Despite the opinions
          f most others including Harry during his early life, 
          Albus Dumbledore trusted Snape for reasons that were kept 
          between them both until their deaths. Despite Snape killing
           Dumbledore, it is learned that they had a special agreement
            for him to do so. When he died, it was revealed that his deep 
            strong love for Lily Evans caused him to redeem himself, 
            joining Dumbledore's cause for her protection (and, after 
            her death, that of her son) from Lord Voldemort.
            The relationship between Dumbledore and Snape would 
            be one of an unusually strong loyalty, so much so that 
            Snape agreed to kill Dumbledore upon the latter's own
             request. Before Dumbledore's death, Snape promised to 
             protect the students of Hogwarts from the Death Eaters
             , who would inevitably take control of the Ministry of
              Magic as well as the school. Snape later participated
               in the Battle of Hogwarts but was murdered by
                Lord Voldemort who mistakenly believed that Snape 
                was the master of the Elder Wand (an immensely strong
                 and powerful wand that Voldemort deeply desired, 
                 as well as one of the Deathly Hallows) when in 
                 reality, Harry Potter was the master of the Elder 
                 Wand, because Draco Malfoy had disarmed Dumbledore 
                 on the night of Dumbledore's death on top of the
                  Astronomy Tower, and Harry had disarmed Draco at
                   Malfoy Manor.

            After Snape's death, Harry Potter ensured that his 
            portrait remained at Hogwarts, honouring him as a hero,
             despite their significant personal differences. In 
             addition, Harry later named his second son Albus Severus
             Potter in honour of Dumbledore and Severus, both of whom
              were an inspiration in Harry's life after the Battle of
               Hogwarts. Harry also was influenced by Severus' Hogwarts
                house, and freely admitted that his son Albus could choose 
                Slytherin if he wished.</span>

<h3><span style="color: khaki;">James Potter-</span></h3>
<span style="color:turquoise">James Potter I (27 March,1960–31 October, 1981),  also known as Prongs, 
    was an English pure-blood wizard and the only son of Fleamont and 
    Euphemia Potter. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 
    1971-1978 and was sorted into Gryffindor. When James started at Hogwarts, he
     met and became best friends with three fellow Gryffindor students: Remus Lupin,
      Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew. He also met Severus Snape, a Slytherin student 
      with whom he became bitter rivals. During his seventh year, James was appointed Head 
      Boy and began dating Lily Evans.
    
    After graduating from Hogwarts, he married Lily and together they had a son,
     Harry James Potter, of whom he made Sirius Black the godfather. James, Lily, 
     and their friends all fought in the First Wizarding War as members of the Order
      of the Phoenix; he and his wife defied Lord Voldemort three times. However, 
      James and Lily were forced to go into hiding after a prophecy was made concerning
       Voldemort and their infant son. James and Lily were ultimately betrayed to
        Voldemort by one of their close friends (Peter Pettigrew).
    
    As a result of this, James was tragically murdered by Voldemort on Hallowe'en in 1981, 
    along with his wife while they were trying to protect Harry.</span>

    <h3><span style="color: khaki;">Lily Potter-</span></h3>
    <span style="color: gold;">Lily J. Potter(30 January,[1] 1960–31 October, 1981) 
         was an English Muggle-born[3] witch, the younger daughter of Mr and Mrs Evans,
          and the younger sister of Petunia Evans. She learned of her magical nature
          as a child, after Severus Snape recognised her as a witch and told her of 
          the existence of magic. Lily attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
          Wizardry from 1971-1978. She was Sorted into Gryffindor House and was a
           member of the Slug Club. In her seventh year she was made Head Girl and
            began dating James Potter.

        After Hogwarts, Lily married James. Along with their friends Sirius Black, 
        Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, the couple joined the Order of the Phoenix
         during the First Wizarding War. She and her husband defied Lord Voldemort 
         himself three times. Shortly afterwards, Lily and James had a son, Harry James
          Potter, of whom they made Sirius the godfather. However, the family was 
          forced to go into hiding after a prophecy was made concerning Lord Voldemort
           and their infant son. She and James were betrayed by Pettigrew and thus
            both were murdered by Voldemort on Hallowe'en night in 1981, while trying
            to protect their son.</span>

              <span style="color:gold">Professor Remus John[2] Lupin, O.M. (First Class), 
                (10 March, 1960–2 May, 1998), also known as Moony, was
                 a half-blood wizard and the only son of Lyall and Hope 
                 Lupin (née Howell). He was attacked by werewolf Fenrir
                  Greyback when he was a child, a result of Greyback's
                   revenge against Lyall, leaving Remus afflicted with 
                   Lycanthropy for life. He attended Hogwarts School of
                    Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1971-1978 and was Sorted 
                    into Gryffindor House. During his school years he was
                     one of the Marauders, best friends with Sirius Black, James Potter,
                      and Peter Pettigrew. Together, they created the Marauder's Map.
  
  After Hogwarts, Remus and his friends joined the original Order of the Phoenix and 
  fought in the First Wizarding War. However, Pettigrew betrayed James and Lily Potter
   to Lord Voldemort a week after he was made the couples' Secret Keeper. Thus Remus had
   
   lost all of his closest friends in various ways by the end of the First Wizarding War.
    The loss of his friends devastated him, though he and Sirius Black later rekindled
     their friendship.
  
  Remus taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as Professor
   of Defence Against the Dark Arts during the 1993–1994 school year. Remus 
   was regarded by students to be the best Defence teacher they have had thus 
   far. He was also a professor of Harry Potter (James' son) whom he taught how 
   to conjure a corporeal Patronus, but resigned after Severus Snape revealed to 
   the public that Remus was a werewolf.
  
  He fought against Death Eaters once more in the Second Wizarding War, during which
   he lost his friend Sirius. In 1997, Remus married fellow Order member Nymphadora 
   Tonks and had a son, Edward Remus Lupin, of whom he named Harry the godfather. Remus
    fought at the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May, 1998, during which his wife was murdered
     by Bellatrix Lestrange. Remus was also murdered by Death Eater Antonin Dolohov,
      during the first half of the same battle. His death was avenged by Filius Flitwick.
      Remus briefly appeared again through the Resurrection Stone for Harry, along with James Potter, Lily Potter, and Sirius Black in 1998. 
      After his death, his son was raised by Andromeda Tonks and Harry Potter.</span>

      <h3><span style="color:darkgray;">NYMPHADORA TONKS</span></h3>
      <span style="color:gold">Nymphadora "Dora" Lupin (née Tonks) 
        (c. 1973[1]–2 May, 1998) more commonly known as Tonks was a British 
        half-blood witch and a Metamorphmagus. She was the only child of Ted
         and Andromeda Tonks (née Black). Tonks attended Hogwarts School of 
         Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1984 to 1991 and was Sorted into Hufflepuff 
         House. She was in the same year at Hogwarts as Gryffindor Charlie Weasley.

        After leaving Hogwarts, Tonks joined the Ministry of Magic and trained to
         become an Auror under the watchful eye of Alastor Moody, qualifying in 1994.
          In 1995, she joined the second Order of the Phoenix, working undercover in
           the Ministry and helping to guard the Department of Mysteries. In June of
            1996, she fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.
        
            In the wake of the return of Lord Voldemort, Tonks was assigned to Hogsmeade as part of the Auror task force 
            sent to guard Hogwarts. She later fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.
        
        
            She gave birth to a son, Teddy Remus Lupin (named after her late father 
            Edward "Teddy") shortly after Easter in 1998 and the couple named Harry the
             godfather. On 2 May, 1998 Tonks fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and was 
             finally murdered by Bellatrix Lestrange, her maternal aunt and a Death Eater, 
             a devoted servant of Lord Voldemort. Her murder was avenged by her order colleague 
             nd friend Molly Weasley. 
            After her death, her son was raised by her mother and Harry.

            Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody (d. 27 July, 1997) was a pure-blood wizard, 
            considered to be the most famous Auror of all time. He was a pivotal 
            member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First and Second Wizarding
             Wars. Moody served with distinction during the first conflict, gaining 
             a reputation as a skilful battler against the Dark Arts and sacrificing 
             an eye, a leg, and part of his nose during the conflict. As an Auror, 
             he played a role in the imprisonment of many of the inhabitants of Azkaban.
             In 1994, he agreed to Albus Dumbledore's request to become the new 
             Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts; however, he was 
             kidnapped just prior to taking up the position by Barty Crouch Jr,
              who subsequently disguised himself as Moody as part of a plan
               to kidnap Harry Potter on the instructions of Lord Voldemort.
               Following his rescue from Barty Crouch Jnr, Moody joined
                the second Order of the Phoenix and fought in a number of the Second 
                Wizarding War's battles, including the Battle of the Department of 
                Mysteries in 1996[15] and the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997, 
                dying during the latter

His magical eye was later used by Dolores Umbridge to spy on her subordinates 
in the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. It was later retrieved by Harry Potter
 when he infiltrated the Ministry of Magic in 1997, and was given a proper burial
  by Harry in the forest close to where the 422nd Quidditch World Cup had been held
  three years prior.

      <span style="color: lightgreen;">  Dobby (28 June (year unknown) – March, 1998) was a male house-elf
        who served the Malfoy family. His masters were Dark Wizards who 
        treated him cruelly. In 1992 he disobeyed his masters and tried
         to warn Harry Potter of the plot to have the Chamber of Secrets 
         reopened. He came to know this via the contact between his masters
          and Lord Voldemort. At the end of that school year, after Harry 
          had vanquished the memory of Tom Riddle and slayed the basilisk in 
          the Chamber of Secrets, he tricked Lucius Malfoy into freeing Dobby.
           Harry accomplished this by placing T. M. Riddle's Diary inside his
            own sock. Lucius disgustedly ripped the sock off the book 
            and threw the sock into the air, where Dobby caught it.Dobby went on 
            to work in the kitchens at Hogwarts, for which he was paid one Galleon
            a week and got one day off each month. He had been accompanied to Hogwarts
             by his friend Winky (who had recently been dismissed) and so began Dobby's
             new happy life nearby his closest friends: Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

            In 1997 Dobby helped Harry spy on Draco Malfoy along with Kreacher. 
            In 1998 he went on Aberforth Dumbledore's orders to save the lives of Harry 
            and his companions from Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor. During this rescue he
             was fatally wounded by Bellatrix Lestrange's knife, but successfully
              apparated Harry and Griphook to safety at Shell Cottage. Harry dug Dobby's
               grave without magic, in the gardens of Shell Cottage and carved into the
                headstone of the grave "HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF."

<span style="color: lightseagreen;">Fred Weasley I (1 April, 1978 – 2 May, 1998) was an English pure-blood wizard,
    was the fourth son and the middle child, the most daring and dominant among the 
    twins of Arthur Weasley and Molly Weasley (née Prewett), younger brother to Bill, 
    Charlie and Percy, and older brother of Ron and Ginny Weasley, and older twin brother
     and best friend to George Weasley. Fred's first few years were marked by the height 
     of the First Wizarding War and when Lord Voldemort fell for the first time.
   
   He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989-1996 and was
