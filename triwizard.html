        The Triwizard Tournament was a magical contest held
        between the three largest wizarding schools of Europe: 
        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
         Durmstrang Institute, and 
         Beauxbatons Academy of Magic,  each school being represented 
         by one Champion. Selected Champions compete in three tasks — 
         traditionally judged by the Headmasters or Headmistresses of
          the competing schools — designed to test magical ability, 
          intelligence, and courage. Champions competed for the honour 
          and glory of winning the Tournament, for the Triwizard Cup,
           and a monetary prize. The first Tournament was held 
           sometime around the late 13th century.
