<span style="color: cyan;">The Deathly Hallows are three highly powerful magical objects 
    supposedly created by Death and given to each of three brothers in 
    the Peverell family. <b>They consisted of the Elder Wand, an immensely 
        powerful wand that was considered unbeatable; the Resurrection Stone,
         a stone which could summon the spirits of the dead, and the Cloak of 
         Invisibility, which, as its name suggests, renders the user completely 
         invisible.</b> According to the story, both Antioch Peverell 
     (owner of the Wand) and Cadmus Peverell (owner of the Stone) 
     came to bad ends. However, Ignotus Peverell's wisdom in requesting 
     the Cloak was rewarded.

     According to legend, he who possesses these three artefacts 
     would become the Master of Death.

     No one but <i> Harry Potter</i> has been known to have been in command of 
     all three at the same time, though he was never in possession of them 
     \all at once (he dropped the stone in the Forbidden Forest just before 
     gaining the wand that he had won the alliance of in a previous scuffle at 
     Malfoy Manor). <i>Albus Dumbledore</i> had also possessed all three, but not all 
     at once, much like Harry, as he was never the true owner of the Cloak.
