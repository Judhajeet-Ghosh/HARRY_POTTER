All first-years at Hogwarts must take seven subjects:
Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History of Magic, 
Defence Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy and Herbology.
 Flying lessons (on broomsticks) are also compulsory.

 <br><br>

 At the end of their second year at Hogwarts, students 
 are required to choose a minimum of two more subjects from the 
 following list: Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, 
 Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures.

 <br><br>

 Very specialised subjects such as Alchemy are 
 sometimes offered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand.
